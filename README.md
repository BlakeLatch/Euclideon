Through my university degree, I have had the opportunity to work with Advanced Innovations AS to assist them in creating a similar platform to Google Maps.
This platform focuses on using 3D scanned data (through Satellite or Lidar) to generate models to scale.

My role was to focus on the Back End to create a system that can manage login states of users, register accounts, and manage sessions as well as assisting other team members 
with their tasks, making me work with the Full Stack of the project.

**Note:** This has not been maintained and currently uses expired accounts/keys so the program won't function as it initially did.
